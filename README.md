# DNCPONY_c+h-lover_Ships-r-allowed
Hello! 
I go by Roka or Trigger
my pronouns are She/her but you can call me whatever name or pronouns the character I'm using ATM

_things I like_: drawing, art, randoms, talking to others, listening to lore, torture, pain and trauma (IN FICTION NOT IRL), writing lore, watching anime, watching gamers, YouTube, visual novels, making characters, making skin in pony town, playing fashion roulettes and find the skins in pony town, animals, my friends, cuddles in pony town (if you want to cuddle in the game you can idm!), ships, randoms, headcanons, aus, songs, song lyrics

_things I don't like_: rude people, people beefing for no reason, being covered in pony town and covering others (if it's in cuddles idm) people who support @bu53 and or do it, p3d05 and 🍇i5t5 (I will commit crimes against one if I see one irl and I say that proudly cus I hate them), people playing the victim, pick mes, people insulting my friends

~•Fandoms I'm in or/and like•~ : murder drones, how to train your dragon, it's not me it's my basement, crowscare, sweet NO death (and other visual novel games made by Arcadekitten like lucky rabbit, my neighbor Enide,Fea's night out), Enigmaverse, campfire cooking in another world with my absurd skill, Inuyasha, hunter x hunter, the freak circus, mushroom oasis, deadplate, rot in paradise, broken colors, forsaken, misterclockworks, manlybadasshero, Lion (I forgot his full channel name but he plays visual novels and streams them and puts videos on YouTube), Eddie (I forgot his full channel name but he's a Mexican guy who reacts to spooky stuff and plays spooky games at least from what I watch), itsfunneh, undertale, little nightmares, stray (the cyberpunk cat game and I have made b-12), Wall-E, Dandys world, and probably wayyy more I'll add later if I remember them
(note: if the developers or people partaking in these fandoms or games are bad people or have done unacceptable things, I'm probably not aware and sure as hell don't support them, I mostly like the characters and the stories, not the makers) 
I'm a multishipper meaning I allow any ships even if it was with my own original characters, and idm yumishippers (people who ship themselves with certain characters) and if you want you can int for the purposes of ships with whatever character I am atm


# HEAVY DNI : child x any adult shippers, animal characters x normal humans/humanoid characters shippers, parent x child shippers, p3d0s, 🍇1st5, 5/@-ers (unless you were FORCED bc I know some people get forced to do that typa crap and feel very guilty so but the ones that aren't unless you're drowning in guilt kys I have very serious hatred towards you mfs cus my friends experienced some of these horrors and people do horrible things to themselves bc of those things, so I mean it when I say kys if you do those things without drowning in guilt, if you don't like it get out) 


-random info about meh-
I do not like being covered or covering someone in pony town so if I move away it doesn't mean I don't like you or I mean hostility I just don't wanna be covered or cover you cus I don't want to be rude ;v;
I'm a lil awkward and I'm mostly quiet and random and I mostly like just listening instead of talking,and if I accidentally shift the conversation to myself it's completely unintentional and something my brain does without meaning to because I'm just trying to figure out a response but don't know what so I instead stay quiet or come up with something,but I've been noticing that so I try to stop it but if I accidentally do it I'm really sorry (◞‸◟ㆀ) and please do inform me if I do it, whenever I'm in pony town I always have to be doing something so usually playing in rps or mini games in docks or talking to my friends
I'm usually in docks or in front of cafe in the forsaken area or in the Dandys world area or in the the freak circus area
I like writing stories and traumatizing my characters and I have like a 20 page essay in my head of lil my world of OCS
I over explain things so I often walltext (aka writing a whole paragraph) I'm sorry if I do that (◞‸◟ㆀ)
I have anger issues and ADHD so I might unintentionally do weird things or get frustrated and angry quickly, I don't mean it so if I get angry at you or make you feel uncomfortable I'm some way I'm supper sorry (◞‸◟ㆀ)
I like being interacted with especially if I have the 'looking for chat' or 'int' in my characters name it means that I would love to be interacted with and don't mind it if you just come up and cuddle with me
I got Walmart Internet so I will prob disconnect more then two time's sanity
I don't like shedletsky or itrapped from forsaken but idm someone int as em I just don't really like em they just pmo

my fictional husbands r
# 1 Mycheal from mushroom oasis
# 2 Ticket Taker from the freak circus
# 3 Jester from the freak circus

I'm not sure if that counts as yumishipping if they are FROM a dating yandere game ;v;, but idk if you int with me as them and ship urself or as MC idm cus I idm sharing :p

I'm a minor so I'm not too comfortable with interacting with ppl over 20 b(I'm under 17 but over 12) but idm being friends
I don't online date like ever but if I'm calling someone or someone is calling me wife or smth like dat they are my bff we ain't dating fam 🙏

my keyboard makes me wanna commit crimes sometimes with how glitchy n laggy it is especially with the typos and autocorrect it pmo sometimes
